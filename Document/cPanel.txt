let me try 
Internal Server Error

The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request.

Please contact the server administrator at webmaster@fns24.com to inform them of the time this error occurred, and the actions you performed just before this error.

More information about this error may be available in the server error log.

Additionally, a 500 Internal Server Error error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.
u guys just allow me login my amp page 
so that i can delete the content from database through cpanel-> phpmyadmin 
Jeremy Sta.
Unfortunately until the suspension is removed AMP access will be unavailable
avatar
okay then remove 500 error
htaccess need to be active for this site I mean mod-rewrite
Jeremy Sta.

Jeremy Sta.
I cant login to your AMP account either with the suspension. I'm working on getting you a password to login for cPanel/WHM
avatar
thanks
Jeremy Sta.
are you able to see this login screen?  
  
https://vps55114.inmotionhosting.com:2087/
avatar
yes
Jeremy Sta.
Ok. I'm waiting for an admin to get us a password since the cPanel account is owned by root I dont have access to reset your password like I normally would
Allow us 5-10 minutes so we can get the login credentials.
avatar
after getting the access and remove the content , how long it would take the time to my site open for all 
Jeremy Sta.
You'll need to reply to the email from our legal team so they can review the information and ensure everything has been removed as they are the only department that can lift the suspension
and they only work through email
avatar
okay 
Jeremy Sta.
I need you to create a password and use this link to send it to me
